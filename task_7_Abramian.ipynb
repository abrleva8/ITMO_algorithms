    "Far down in the depths below him;\n",
    "See the yellow perch, the Sahwa,\n",
    "Like a sunbeam in the water,\n",
    "See the Shawgashee, the craw-fish,\n",
    "Like a spider on the bottom,\n",
    "On the white and sandy bottom.\n",
    "  At the stern sat Hiawatha,\n",
    "With his fishing-line of cedar;\n",
    "In his plumes the breeze of morning\n",
    "Played as in the hemlock branches;\n",

    "Plates of bone upon his forehead,\n",
    "Down his sides and back and shoulders\n",
    "Plates of bone with spines projecting!\n",
    "Painted was he with his war-paints,\n",

    "Spots of brown and spots of sable;\n",
    "And he lay there on the bottom,\n",
    "Fanning with his fins of purple,\n",
    "As above him Hiawatha\n",
    "In his birch canoe came sailing,\n",
    "With his fishing-line of cedar.\n",
    "  \"Take my bait,\" cried Hiawatha,\n",

    "  In his fingers Hiawatha\n",

    "Like a birch log in the water,\n",
    "With the squirrel, Adjidaumo,\n",
    "Perched and frisking on the summit.\n",
    "  Full of scorn was Hiawatha\n",
    "When he saw the fish rise upward,\n",

    "You are but the pike, Kenozha,\n",

    "You are not the King of Fishes!\"\n",

    "To the bream, with scales of crimson,\n",
    "\"Take the bait of this great boaster,\n",

    "Swung with all his weight upon it,\n",
    "Made a whirlpool in the water,\n",
    "Whirled the birch canoe in circles,\n",
    "Round and round in gurgling eddies,\n",
    "Till the circles in the water\n",
    "Reached the far-off sandy beaches,\n",
    "Till the water-flags and rushes\n",
    "Nodded on the distant margins.\n",
    "  But when Hiawatha saw him\n",
    "Slowly rising through the water,\n",
    "Lifting up his disk refulgent,\n",

    "Sank the Ugudwash, the sun-fish,\n",
    "And again the sturgeon, Nahma,\n",
    "Heard the shout of Hiawatha,\n",
    "Heard his challenge of defiance,\n",
    "The unnecessary tumult,\n",
    "Ringing far across the water.\n",
    "  From the white sand of the bottom\n",
    "Up he rose with angry gesture,\n",
    "Quivering in each nerve and fibre,\n",
    "Clashing all his plates of armor,\n",
    "Gleaming bright with all his war-paint;\n",
    "In his wrath he darted upward,\n",
    "Flashing leaped into the sunshine,\n",
    "Opened his great jaws, and swallowed\n",
    "Both canoe and Hiawatha.\n",
    "  Down into that darksome cavern\n",
    "Plunged the headlong Hiawatha,\n",
    "As a log on some black river\n",
    "Shoots and plunges down the rapids,\n",
    "Found himself in utter darkness,\n",
    "Groped about in helpless wonder,\n",
    "Till he felt a great heart beating,\n",
    "Throbbing in that utter darkness.\n",
    "  And he smote it in his anger,\n",
    "With his fist, the heart of Nahma,\n",
    "Felt the mighty King of Fishes\n",
    "Shudder through each nerve and fibre,\n",
    "Heard the water gurgle round him\n",
    "As he leaped and staggered through it,\n",
    "Sick at heart, and faint and weary.\n",
    "  Crosswise then did Hiawatha\n",
    "Drag his birch-canoe for safety,\n",
    "Lest from out the jaws of Nahma,\n",
    "In the turmoil and confusion,\n",
    "Forth he might be hurled and perish.\n",
    "And the squirrel, Adjidaumo,\n",
    "Frisked and chatted very gayly,\n",
    "Toiled and tugged with Hiawatha\n",
    "Till the labor was completed.\n",
    "  Then said Hiawatha to him,\n",
    "\"O my little friend, the squirrel,\n",
    "Bravely have you toiled to help me;\n",

    "And the name which now he gives you;\n",

    "Boys shall call you Adjidaumo,\n",
    "Tail-in-air the boys shall call you!\"\n",
    "  And again the sturgeon, Nahma, \n",
    "Gasped and quivered in the water,\n",
    "Then was still, and drifted landward\n",
    "Till he grated on the pebbles,\n",
    "Till the listening Hiawatha\n",
    "Heard him grate upon the margin,\n",
    "Felt him strand upon the pebbles,\n",
    "Knew that Nahma, King of Fishes,\n",
    "Lay there dead upon the margin.\n",
    "  Then he heard a clang and flapping,\n",
    "As of many wings assembling,\n",
    "Heard a screaming and confusion,\n",
    "As of birds of prey contending,\n",
    "Saw a gleam of light above him,\n",
    "Shining through the ribs of Nahma,\n",
    "Saw the glittering eyes of sea-gulls,\n",
    "Of Kayoshk, the sea-gulls, peering,\n",
    "Gazing at him through the opening,\n",
    "Heard them saying to each other,\n",
    "\"'T is our brother, Hiawatha!\"\n",
    "  And he shouted from below them,\n",
    "Cried exulting from the caverns:\n",
    "\"O ye sea-gulls! O my brothers!\n",
    "I have slain the sturgeon, Nahma;\n",

    "Calling you Kayoshk, the sea-gulls,\n",
    "Yes, Kayoshk, the Noble Scratchers!\"\n",
    "  And the wild and clamorous sea-gulls\n",
    "Toiled with beak and claws together,\n",
    "Made the rifts and openings wider\n",

    "And from peril and from prison,\n",
    "From the body of the sturgeon,\n",
    "From the peril of the water,\n",
    "They released my Hiawatha.\n",
    "  He was standing near his wigwam,\n",
    "On the margin of the water,\n",
    "And he called to old Nokomis,\n",
    "Called and beckoned to Nokomis,\n",
    "Pointed to the sturgeon, Nahma,\n",
    "Lying lifeless on the pebbles,\n",
    "With the sea-gulls feeding on him.\n",
    "  \"I have slain the Mishe-Nahma,\n",

    "To their nests among the rushes.\n",
